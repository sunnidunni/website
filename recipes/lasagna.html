      filling that it's worth it!

      When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than
      20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would become. One of our
      top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more
      than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular
      lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately, John
      unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old â€” read all about his life and
      legacy here.
